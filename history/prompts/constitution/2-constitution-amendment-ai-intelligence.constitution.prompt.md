# Constitution Amendment — Formalize AI-Driven Book Intelligence

## PROMPT_TEXT

```
/sp.update-constitution TITLE: Constitution Amendment — Formalize AI-Driven Book Intelligence (No Behavior Changes)

INTENT:
Update the constitution ONLY to formally acknowledge AI-driven book intelligence features
that already exist in the codebase. This amendment must not alter or weaken any existing
constitutional rules.

STRICT RULES:
- Use SpecKit Plus only
- NO vibe coding
- NO implementation
- NO feature redesign
- NO removal or modification of existing constitutional clauses
- Only additive clarification is allowed

AMENDMENTS TO ADD (EXPLICIT):

1. Add a new constitutional section: "AI-Augmented Book Intelligence"
   This section MUST state that the system MAY include:
   - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strictly grounded in book content
   - Authentication-backed personalization
   - Language translation as a non-destructive view layer
   - Reusable intelligence via spec-defined subagents

2. Explicitly reaffirm:
   - All AI outputs must be traceable to source documents
   - No hallucination is permitted
   - No AI behavior changes to existing constitutional principles
```

## RESPONSE_TEXT

The constitution has been successfully updated to formally acknowledge the AI-driven book intelligence features that already exist in the codebase. The amendment adds a new section "AI-Augmented Book Intelligence" that:

1. Permits specific AI features:
   - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with provenance tracking
   - Authentication-backed personalization
   - Non-destructive language translation
   - Reusable intelligence via spec-defined subagents

2. Maintains strict constraints:
   - All AI outputs must be traceable to source documents
   - No hallucination is permitted
   - AI-generated content must be clearly labeled
   - Original content remains unchanged

The amendment preserves all existing constitutional principles and does not alter or weaken any existing rules. The constitution version has been updated from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2.

## OUTCOME

The constitution now formally acknowledges the implemented AI features (RAG, personalization, translation, subagents) while maintaining all existing constitutional principles. This amendment provides formal recognition of the AI-driven book intelligence features without changing any existing constitutional rules.

## EVALUATION

The constitution amendment successfully achieves its goal:
- ✅ Adds formal recognition of existing AI features
- ✅ Maintains all existing constitutional principles
- ✅ Preserves the integrity of the original constitution
- ✅ Provides clear constraints for AI feature usage
- ✅ No existing clauses were modified or weakened
